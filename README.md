# The Developer Community Toolkit

It is the goal of this repository to collect information, best practices, articles, videos, templates and any other kind of resource that may be helpful for people who are interested in organizing events in the developer community. These events include but are not limited to:
- Hack days
- Meetups
- Conferences
- Workshops

This toolkit is a project of the community and contributions are needed! If you have anything you'd like to add, please [fork this project on GitHub](https://github.com/crabasa/community-toolkit) and send us a pull request.
